## I am aware of
- Reassignment to `@nodes` in `load_nodes` during merge.
- The limitations of class variable storage (used for persistence).
- Extra work done on finding the shortest path (out of spec).  Was useful for testing though.
- A DP approach to the Floydâ€“Warshall Algo, should be recursive.  Would argue that the DP approach is best here though.
